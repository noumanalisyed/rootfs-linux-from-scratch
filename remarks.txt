General:

- buildroot does not update *.pc files which may lead to issues later on. So I've add this feature.
- When updating references in *.pc and *.la files, sometimes the staging directory is present. This also needs to be replaced. I've added install-functions which does the full backward and forward replacement.

expat-2.2.0

-

zlib-1.2.11

- For some strange reason, some variables are placed in a different position:
ac_cv_lbl_unaligned_fail=no \
ac_cv_func_mmap_fixed_mapped=yes \
ac_cv_func_memcmp_working=yes \
ac_cv_have_decl_malloc=yes \
gl_cv_func_malloc_0_nonnull=yes \
ac_cv_func_malloc_0_nonnull=yes \
ac_cv_func_calloc_0_nonnull=yes \
ac_cv_func_realloc_0_nonnull=yes \
lt_cv_sys_lib_search_path_spec="" \
ac_cv_c_bigendian=no

libpng-1.6.28

- Although LDFLAGS_FOR_BUILD is defined correctly, libz.so cannot be found by configure Additionally specifying LDFLAGS="-L$staging_directory/usr/lib" works, but is in conflict with buildroot!
- Similarly, zlib.h is not found by build unless CPATH=$PREFIX/include is specified.

freetype-2.7.1

-

fontconfig-2.12.1

- Font cache is not generated by build, need to run fc-cache at some time

util-macros-1.19.1

- Is mention as xutil_util-macros, but build later in buildroot, but is needed for libpciaccess.

libpciaccess-0.13.4

- Although LDFLAGS_FOR_BUILD is defined correctly, libz.so cannot be found by configure Additionally specifying LDFLAGS="-L$staging_directory/usr/lib" works, but is in conflict with buildroot!
- Similarly, zlib.h is not found by build unless CPATH=$PREFIX/include is specified, both for configure and make.

libpthread-stubs-0.3

-

libffi-3.2.1

- Needs auto-reconf, so added this as option to package.

ncurses-5.9

- Needed by readline. Weirdly complains about usr/lib/pkgconfig/zlib.pc not being a directory, while trying to install .pc files. However ncurses does itself not generate a .pc file.

readline-7.0

-

util-linux-2.29.2

-

libdrm-2.4.75

- Is supposed to depend on udev, but builds fine without it.

xcb-proto-1.12

- 

xproto_xproto-7.0.31

wayland-1.13.0

-

xlib_libXext-1.3.3

-

xproto_dri2proto-2.8

- X proto packages are not installed to the target by buildroot. We still do this, just be sure, but might add an option to stop installing to the target.

xproto_glproto-1.4.17

- Enabled auto detection, however still no autoaudiosink or autovideosink present.

libglu-9.0.0

-

gst1-plugins-bad-1.10.4

- Blocks on gettextize. We need to build our own gettext package, as buildroot does. Now added.
- As gettextize is in a different directory, it is important to specify gettext_datadir=$staging_directory/usr/share/gettext when calling gettextize
- For the same reason , it is important to specify AUTOM4TE=/usr/bin/autom4te gettext_datadir=$staging_directory/usr/share/gettext when calling autoreconfigure.
